# Using Oxygen to Code with XML
For this project, I was assigned a portion of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula’s Guest” to code using Text Encoding Initiative, more commonly known as TEI. This short horror story was published in 1914 and details the experience of an Englishman on his trip to Munich on Walpurgis night. My specific section of the text covered two paragraphs over pages 7 and 8, and I was tasked with using Oxygen, which is a coding program that uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML), to code the text as it appeared in the story. Before beginning to use the XML editor, we mimicked the markup in Google Docs.

The text of our assigned sections of the manuscript was copied into individual Google Docs. We used the comment feature to make note of paragraph beginnings and endings, page breaks, quotations, em-dashes, titles, inscriptions, bylines, and more. I was lucky enough to have very few elements to markup, making note of the beginnings and endings of the two paragraphs and the page break. My section also included a note about cypress and yew being commonly found in cemeteries, but this was added by my professor on the Google Doc.

Looking at the plain text on the Google Doc and adding comments to identify what elements we were going to code for in Oxygen made it a lot less intimidating. It really helped to break down the text so we could visually see every aspect that would be inputted into the program.
  
I was not too nervous about this coding project, as I have had some experience working with HTML tags from when I took an introductory computing class. After opening Oxygen, I realized that the tags were very similar to those of HTML, so I felt pretty confident in my abilities to master the program. 

The paragraph tags were familiar to me, but the page break and note tags were new. Instead of the text being enclosed inside a beginning and end tag, these fell right in the center of the paragraph. I found this interesting, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly, and it was easy to make sure that everything was correct. 
  
Coding is very detail oriented and specific, so if there is just one letter or symbol incorrect or out of place, the code will be invalid. One aspect of the Oxygen program that is very helpful is the box in the top right corner, as it will be green if the code is valid and red if it is invalid. This was very useful in making sure everything was in place and written exactly the way that it should be. 

The “Author” tab on the bottom of the program was another useful feature of this program. It allowed us to see how the text would look online based on the way that we had coded it. I could see if the paragraphs were broken up the right way and if the note and page break were in the right place.

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. Coding can be very intimidating at first, but I would like to learn more about it and do more practice with it. I think that it is a useful skill to have and I would like to be more well-versed on it. Working in Oxygen with TEI was a good introduction into the world of coding and this project showed one way that this skill can be applied.
