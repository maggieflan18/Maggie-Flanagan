# About Me Blog

My name is Maggie Flanagan and my pronouns are she/her. As a sophomore at Christopher Newport University, I am majoring in English and Political Science with minors in Writing and Human Rights & Conflict Resolution. 
## Academics
As of now, I am unsure of exactly what career path I would like to pursue after graduation, but I have interests in publishing, foreign affairs, and research and data analysis. In order to continue narrowing down what specific fields and areas of study I would like a career in, I have taken a variety of courses in both writing and political science.
I am planning to go to graduate school after my four years at CNU, but I am looking to get an internship or do research with a teacher during my undergraduate studies in order to gain more experience. 
Because I am interested in careers that involve writing, I want to be well-versed on writing for different audiences and occasions. That is why I decided to take a course on writing for digital humanities. I am excited to learn more about what DH is and how the aspects of the field can fit into my own life. I think that it is going to be a very interesting course that will expand my writing abilities and broaden my skill set.
Knowing how to write is an essential part of every career and it is a vital communication skill, so I would like to be efficient at every kind of writing that I can. I have taken a creative writing class during my freshman year and I am currently enrolled in a creative nonfiction class, so I am trying to hit all the bases. 
## Personal Life
Outside of academics, I am a member of the CNU club field hockey team and I enjoy going to the gym. When the weather is nice at CNU, my friends and I will take day trips to the beach on the weekend. We also frequently attend CNU sporting events, especially football and basketball.

My hometown is Sterling, VA and I have two sisters and one brother. My older sister is a senior at CNU and attending the same school as her made my transition into college much easier. My younger sister is a freshman at VCU and my brother works in plumbing. I also have an old and cranky chihuahua-terrier mix named Sammy. In my spare time, I love to read, hang out with my friends, and spend time with my family.
