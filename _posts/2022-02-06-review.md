The Grand Tour Project (GTP) is a digital humanities project that presents a case study of sixty-nine British architects who traveled to Italy in the 18th century to take part in the Grand Tour. The Grand Tour was an educational journey and rite of passage for many wealthy young males that exposed them to Western art. This website aims to use interactive aspects to illustrate these travels. Mapped details depict these architects’ education, sources of funding, and their connections in the social, academic, and professional fields. The use of interactive elements provides information about the timeline and locations of the architects’ individual travels. This project hopes to widen the understanding of the role these architects played during the Grand Tour of Italy. 

The GTP takes information from over 5000 entries in the Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800, which John Ingamells compiled from the Brinsley Ford Archive. This project transforms this information into a searchable database that includes digital visualizations of both the travelers’ journeys and their lives.

The home page of the project provides a brief summary about the Grand Tour and the goals of the project. There is a link to the “Interact” section that invites users to see the data in a new way. Within it, there are 5 different maps, timecharts, and graphs that the reader can choose to interact with.

One of these charts, titled “Timechart of Architects’ Travels,” represents the tours of the architects. It provides information about the location and duration of their stays. It has a color-coded key that makes it easy to identify the different places that these travelers visited. The colors are both distinguishable and visually appealing. Those interacting with the chart can click on individual travels to gain information about the time and place. There is also a search bar that allows users to choose a specific location, as well as a filter bar that allows users to look up names. The instructions above the timechart are clear and easily readable, making it easy to explore and interact with. 

However, the “Project Index'' button at the bottom of the page does not work, as it merely flashes black when clicked on. Another present issue is that it is very difficult to navigate back to the other interactive charts, or any of the other offshoots of the home page. There are three tabs at the top of the screen marked “Introduction, “Project Index,” and “About.” When clicked on, they take the user to a completely different page with none of the original tabs. The only way to return to the main “Interact” page is to use the back arrow on the browser. A potential remedy for this problem would be the addition of a button that takes users directly back to the home page. Otherwise, it can be very confusing and cause the user to get lost in the site, which may result in a loss of interest due to frustration.

Another interactive item is the “Map of Architects’ Travels.” It presents a map with colored dots that represent the places visited by the architects during their travels. Hovering over the dot provides information of the location name and the number of architects who traveled there. This feature works well and the color stands out and encourages users to click on the dots. Underneath the map there is a timespan filter that has black lines which represent individual architects' tours. One very interesting feature is the interaction between the map and the chart. Users are able to select a specific period on the timespan filter that changes the map to reflect the travels that occurred in the selected period. This unique tool encourages those visiting the site to play around and interact with the information. 

The only drawback is that the selection can be a bit tricky, as it can sometimes get stuck on one selected period. This makes it difficult to select a different part of the timespan. One way to improve usability is to include a reset button that sets the map and timespan back to its original form.

A third form of interacting with the site is with the graphs of education and funding. These graphs show a web diagram that links the architects to different categories of education or funding, depending on which graph is being viewed. There are lists at the bottom of the graph that alter how the information is presented based on what the user clicks on. Illustrating these tangible connections in an interactive way allows readers to gain a better understanding of the background of these architects.

Because the graph takes up the entire width of the page and can be moved around with the mouse, it can be difficult to scroll down through the page. The graphs are very sensitive to the mouse and become very crowded when the user tries to scroll down. If the size was minimized a small amount to leave a bit more room on the side for scrolling, this page would be a lot more user-friendly. 

Overall, this project is well-designed with a lot of interesting interactive elements that present information about the architects and their travels to Italy to the readers in a new way. It has a few usability issues that make it difficult to navigate the site and experience each part of it, but changes can easily be made to improve the ease of access. The Grand Tour Project has a lot of potential to expand on what it has already done and educate readers at any and all levels of knowledge about the lives and journeys of the Europeans travelers.
