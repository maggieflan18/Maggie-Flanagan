# Reflection on Writing for the Digital Humanities
When I signed up for this class, I was unfamiliar with digital humanities. I was interested in learning about a different kind of writing than what I would be doing in my other courses this semester as an English major/writing minor. During the first couple weeks of the semester, we discussed what digital humanities is. One of the activities we did was interacting with Jason Heppler’s website, “What is Digital Humanities.” This website provides a new definition of digital humanities each time you refresh the page.

Using this website and reading some of the definitions made me a little nervous for this class because there were so many different ideas. I was worried that if I didn’t even know how to define the concept of digital humanities, then how was I to understand it and succeed? In one of our class sessions, we were asked to come up with our own definition of digital humanities. I struggled with this activity because I wanted to be exactly right, which was an impossible goal. My original definition was “digital humanities appears to be utilizing technology to interpret and interact with information in a new way.” My lack of confidence is apparent in the use of the phrase “appears to be,” but with this very basic and unstable definition, we started the class. 

Even if I couldn’t nail down a perfect definition of digital humanities right off the bat, our class learned how to identify what is, and what isn’t, a digital humanities project. Vincent Brown’s “Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761: A Cartographic Narrative” was one of the projects that helped me solidify my understanding of the necessary interactive component of digital humanities. This project also played a role later in the semester in inspiring the style of my project for the grant proposal.

We also completed different blog posts over the course of the semester, and they were important for a few reasons. First, they taught us how to write in different styles. The all about me blog focused on presenting personal details professionally. The review blog taught us more about what makes a good digital humanities project, as well as how to write in a way that is critical and evaluative, but still polite and appreciative. The TEI blog introduced us to coding and emphasized the detail-oriented aspect of it. Each of these assignments improved my writing skills in a different way, and I feel that I am a better student for having done them.

Our biggest assignment this semester was the grant project. The project consisted of four steps to be completed throughout the semester to make sure that we were on track. First, we pitched three different ideas for digital humanities projects that we wanted to create. When we started brainstorming in class, my mind immediately went blank. I started looking at examples of other DH projects to get some inspiration, and I began reflecting on the information I had learned in my courses as a politcal science major. I thought that this would be a good chance for me to combine my interests of political science and writing, so I pitched an idea about mapping the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war. This is the idea that got approved.

The second step was the annotated bibliography. We had to find at least ten sources related to our topic and write a short paragraph explaining the argument and relevance of each source. During this leg of the project, I improved on my research and analysis skills. I was able to sort out which sections of my project each source would contribute to and why, and this step ensured that we were all well-informed on the topic of our project. 

The third step was the most involved of them all. We drafted the project description, which had to be a minimum of 1500 words. This was in addition to a 250 word abstract and a one-page resume or 2-page CV. One of the most important things that we did at this stage was reading and discussing Robert Porter’s article “Why Academics Have a Hard Time Writing Good Grant Proposals.” This article clearly laid out the differences between scholarly writing and grant proposals, which was key in our first draft.

The last step of this assignment was the final draft. After receiving feedback from our peers and professor during the first draft process, we had to trim our project description down to 1000 words maximum. This was one of the most difficult parts of the entire class. Being concise is essential to writing a good grant proposal, but being descriptive and wordy is common in scholarly writing, which is the style that I am most familiar with. I read over my project dozens of times, taking it line by line, to eliminate any words I could. I read over it backwards to see if anything stuck out as unnecessary. I was eventually able to cut it down, and I feel really good about my final product. 

This class has taught me a lot. I have learned how to write in different styles, and how to do basic XML coding with Oxygen. I’ve improved on my research and analysis skills. I can now recognize the difference between digital humanities and things that are just digital. Above all, it taught me that digital humanities will likely never have one definition locked down, but that I should have confidence in my own understanding of it. 

We ended one of our final classes by redefining digital humanities. I have gained confidence in my understanding over the course of the semester, and thus in my new definition. It doesn’t “appear to be” anything, it is something. Digital humanities is the intersection of digital technology and traditional humanities that uses interactive elements to inspire new interpretations of information.
